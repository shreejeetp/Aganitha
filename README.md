Library can be compiled using setup.py, after compilation string can be passed to converter1 function which returns converted string.

Also the priority of the conversion is established by the order in which each individual conversion function is invoked.

Main.py contains a demo version of the library



Due to time limit and connection problem at my end, im only able to make a most simplistic part of problem asked, but more conversions can be added by simply adding more regular expression functions
